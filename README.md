# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Tasks

My task for this weeks homework is to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. We need to store the users high scores.

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
